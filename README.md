What does a learning audit look like?
- Make a list containing a list item for each Course Module you've done so far (On-boarding, Software, Frontend, Backend, Database).
- For each item (Course Module) make a sub list containing the things we asked you to learn that week.
- Next to each sub list item give yourself a confidence rating of (Green, Orange or Red). 
- Now prioritise and pick 3 items to take action on (self-study / practice).
- Now learn and practice.
