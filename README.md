## What does a learning audit look like?
- Make a list containing a list item for each Course Module you've done so far (On-boarding, Software, Frontend, Backend, Database).
- For each item (Course Module) make a sub list containing the things we asked you to learn that week.
- Next to each sub list item give yourself a confidence rating of (Green, Orange or Red). 
- Now prioritise and pick 3 items to take action on (self-study / practice).
- Now learn and practice.

## How to work:
- Accept the Github Assignment.
- Make a markdown file called learning-audit.md in the empty repo.
- Write your learning audit in there including the prioritised plan of action.
- The plan should prioritise 3 things you want to become more confident on over the weekend.
- The plan could also include the "how" you plan to become more confident (articles, videos, courses, code katas - and links to them)
- Take action on the prioritised plan and do that learning.
- We want to see you make commits to the repo over the weekend showing either learning notes or code (practicing things)
